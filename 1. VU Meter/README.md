# 1 - VU Meter
This example uses the LEDs as a VU meter for audio inputs 1 & 2

## Experiment
- Change the levels at which the LEDs light up in showVal
- Reverse the LEDs so the minimum volume is at the top and maximum at the bottom

## Extend
- Change the code to be a peak meter
- Use the switch to toggle between 'live' level and peak
