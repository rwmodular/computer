# 2 - Pulse Out
This example outputs a repeating pulse at pulse out 1.

The rate of the pulse can be changed using the big knob.

## Experiment
- Change the length of the pulse
- Change how the knob controls the gap between pulses - allow a wider range of values or a shorter range of values focused on smaller or larger gaps between pulses

## Extend
- Use one of the LEDs to show when a pulse is being output
- Output a second pulse at pulse out 2 (pin 9) at half or twice the rate of the first pulse
