# Music Thing Modular Computer MicroPython Examples
These examples show some basic uses of the Music Thing Modular Computer module using the micropython language.

## Setup
- Remove the large knob from the module to access the boot select button
- Connect a USB cable from the module to your computer
- Insert a card into the card slot (the contents will be overwritten)
- Hold the boot select button while turning on your eurorack system
- Install Thonny and copy the MicroPython firmware to the module using the instructions at https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico
- Open one of the example .py files in Thonny and click on the Play button to send it to the module

After installing the MicroPython firmware onto the card you won't need to do it again. If you turn your eurorack system off and on again, it will be ready to send receive code from Thonny
